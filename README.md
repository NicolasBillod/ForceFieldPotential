# ForceFieldPotential

A Serious Game to help students learn about forces and potentials, developed on the Unity game engine in C# using an Entity-Component-System architectural pattern.
This game is the result of a project we worked on during our Master's degree at UPMC (Pierre et Marie Curie University) within the ISG course, Paris, in 2017-2018.

The development of the game didn't stop there though, Nicolas continued to work on it during his end of study internship with a new team and a few graphic artists. You can check the state of the game at the end of his internship on his GitHub page: https://github.com/NicolasBillod


We hope you enjoy playing it as much as we enjoyed create it!
